## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yakobi0227/Alcatraz.git
cd Alcatraz

# No external dependencies needed! Uses Python standard library only
python3 --version  # Requires Python 3.6+
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
python3 escape_solver.py '<puzzle>' [context] [hint_level]
```

**Parameters:**
- `puzzle` (required): The puzzle text to solve
- `context` (optional): Context about the room or previous puzzles
- `hint_level` (optional): Level of help - "hint", "nudge", or "full" (default: "hint")

### Examples

**Caesar Cipher:**
```bash
python3 escape_solver.py 'KHOOR ZRUOG'
```

**Morse Code:**
```bash
python3 escape_solver.py '.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..'
```

**Base64:**
```bash
python3 escape_solver.py 'VGhlIGtleSBpcyB1bmRlciB0aGUgbWF0'
```

**Number Pattern:**
```bash
python3 escape_solver.py 'What comes next: 2, 4, 6, 8, ?' '' 'full'
```

**Riddle:**
```bash
python3 escape_solver.py "I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter but can't go outside. What am I?" "Mysterious voice" "nudge"
```

**Combination Lock:**
```bash
python3 escape_solver.py "4-digit combination lock" "" "full"
```

**Comprehensive Lock Guide:**
```bash
python3 combination_lock_guide.py
```
This provides a complete guide with 8 strategies for solving combination locks.

### Running Examples

Test the solver with pre-built examples:

```bash
python3 examples.py
```

## Python API

You can also use Alcatraz programmatically:

```python
from escape_solver import EscapeRoomSolver

solver = EscapeRoomSolver()

result = solver.solve(
    puzzle=".... . .-.. .-.. ---",
    context="Found in the radio room",
    hint_level="full"
)

print(result['solutions'][0]['final_answer'])  # HELLO
```

## Output Format

Alcatraz returns a JSON object with:

```json
{
  "puzzle_types": ["caesar_cipher", "..."],
  "analysis": "The puzzle appears to be...",
  "solutions": [
    {
      "label": "Caesar Cipher (shift 3)",
      "steps": ["1. Identify...", "2. Try shifts...", "3. Decode..."],
      "final_answer": "HELLO WORLD",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "hint_level_available": ["hint", "nudge", "full_explanation"]
    }
  ],
  "alternative_interpretations": [
    {
      "description": "Could be a substitution cipher",
      "confidence": 0.3
    }
  ],
  "hints": {
    "hint": "The text appears to be encoded...",
    "nudge": "This is a Caesar cipher. Try shifting letters...",
    "full_explanation": "Solution: HELLO WORLD\n\nSteps:\n1. ..."
  },
  "next_puzzle_prediction": "Likely a more complex cipher or physical puzzle..."
}
```

## Supported Puzzle Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Caesar Cipher** | Letter shifting encryption | `KHOOR ZRUOG` → `HELLO WORLD` |
| **Atbash Cipher** | Reverse alphabet (A↔Z, B↔Y) | `SVOOL` → `HELLO` |
| **Base64** | Binary-to-text encoding | `SGVsbG8=` → `Hello` |
| **Morse Code** | Dots and dashes | `.... ..` → `HI` |
| **Math Puzzle** | Calculations and equations | `15 + 27 = ?` → `42` |
| **Pattern** | Number sequences | `2, 4, 6, ?` → `8` |
| **Riddle** | Word-based logic | "What has keys but no locks?" |
| **Anagram** | Letter rearrangement | "SILENT" → "LISTEN" |
| **Combination Lock** | Physical lock strategies | 4-digit lock → 8 solving strategies |
| **Physical Props** | Escape room objects | Locks, safes, mechanisms |

## Hint Levels

- **hint**: Gentle nudge in the right direction
- **nudge**: More specific guidance about the puzzle type
- **full**: Complete solution with step-by-step explanation

## How It Works

1. **Classification**: Analyzes puzzle text to identify type(s)
2. **Pattern Detection**: Looks for cipher patterns, word structures, number sequences
3. **Solution Generation**: Applies appropriate solving algorithms
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Ranks solutions by likelihood
5. **Hint Generation**: Creates progressive hints based on puzzle type
6. **Prediction**: Suggests what might come next in the escape room

## Special Features

### Combination Lock Guide

The `combination_lock_guide.py` provides an exhaustive, print-ready guide for solving physical combination locks:

**8 Comprehensive Strategies:**
1. **Clue Hunting** - Find numbers in dates, clocks, books, artwork, etc.
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Count objects, identify sequences
3. **Previous Puzzle Solutions** - Connect to earlier answers
4. **Theme-Based Codes** - Use room theme for context
5. **Common Default Codes** - Try frequently-used combinations
6. **Advanced Lock Techniques** - Listening, feeling, UV light, magnets
7. **Systematic Brute Force** - Last resort methodical approach
8. **Teamwork & Organization** - Efficient team coordination

Run the guide:
```bash
python3 combination_lock_guide.py
```

This is perfect for:
- Learning escape room solving techniques
- Teaching puzzle-solving strategies
- Understanding lock mechanisms
